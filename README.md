# Random Movie Generator

A website that takes user input, in the form of dropdown menus, and returns a random movie within a given Genre and Streaming Service.

## User Story

This is Project 1 within the UT Austin Full Stack Bootcamp. We were given no starter code for this and the teams were assigned by the instructional staff.

We were tasked with:
- Creating a website that could do anything of our choosing.
- The website needs to use at least 2 seperate APIs.
- We need to use a CSS frame work other than Bootstrap.
